Client section of the case creation form is as simple as it seems. The user just needs to select the corresponding client from the drop down list. If the user can't find the client by scrolling through the list, client can also be found by typing the keywords.

In the lawyer section more than one lawyer and multiple secretaries in charge can be added to the case.
