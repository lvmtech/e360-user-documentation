## Creating a Client

If the "Create New Client" button is clicked, a modal will show up which will ask for the new client's details. The client creation form has four parts, "Info", "Postal Address", "Billing Address" and "Payment Settings". Each part will be covered in the follwing content. There is something important to note here, if there is an asterisk(*) beside the field name it means you must fill relevant data in that field and that field must not be empty.

### Info

There are two types of clients, company and person, that can be entered. 

The main differences in entering data for company and person types are the top three fields. For the company type clients, the top three fields would be "Company Name", "Tax Registered" and "Business Registration Number", and for the person type clients, they are "ID Card Number", "ID photo" and "Date of Birth".

The info part of create client form also contains "Client ID", which is automatically generated after saving, "Salutation", "First Name", "Last Name", "Email", "Mobile", "Created By", "Referred By" and "Date Created", all of which must be filled. "Fax", "Phone" and "Notes", which is for adding any additional information related to the client needed to be entered.

### Billing Address

Billing Address can be the same as postal address so if the check box telling "Billing address is same as above" is ticked, postal address does not need to be entered again. If the check box is not checked, you need to provide information for billing address. The fields are the same as postal address part. Both of the scenarios can be seen in the following pictures.

## Viewing audit history

## Updating a Client

Edit button will be disabled if no client is selected as it appears in the picture of top menu introduction section. If the "Edit" button from the top menu is clicked, a form filled with selected client's details will show up and those fields can be edited and then saved. All the fields of update form are the same as create form so edit form will not be broken down in details in this section.

## Archiving a Client
Archiving a client does not delete the client permanently. It is more like a soft delete and the archived data, which can be client, case or invoices, can be retrieved back by unarchiving. 

### Showing archived Client list
